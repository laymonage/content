So, how was 2024?

## Brussels and FOSDEM

I kicked off the year with getting a visa for Belgium 🇧🇪 to attend FOSDEM. The
earliest available appointment was only two weeks before the event. After some
back and forth and a few missing documents, I got the visa just in time.

![Tom, Thibaud, Sarah, and me at the Atomium](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/atomium_2024.avif)

My friends and I explored Brussels for a bit. We visited the [Atomium][atomium]
and got a photo printed. I got some chocolates to bring back home. Storm and I
met in person for the first time.

![Me presenting my talk at FOSDEM](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/fosdem_2024.jpg)

The event itself was... alright. It was very, very packed – both in terms of
attendance and the schedule. [I presented my talk on Wagtail][fosdem-talk] to a
room full of seasoned PHP CMS developers. Not my best presentation. Didn't
handle the questions very well, either. But it was worth a try. I probably won't
go again next year.

## Ramadan and Jakarta

In the last(-ish) week of March, I went back to Jakarta to celebrate Ramadan and
Eid with my family and friends. Spent the whole of April before I returned to
the UK in May.

[I wrote more about it previously][thoughts-2024-05-06]. Though, reading that
again, it sounds a bit too bitter. It was much better than that. Especially now
that I have some of the answers. Thank you everyone who spared the time to catch
up ❤️

## Visa troubles: DjangoCon Europe, Wagtail Space NL

Due to some issues in getting another 🇪🇺 visa in time, I did not make it to
DjangoCon Europe this year. Sorry, Vigo 🇪🇸 ⛔

![Me presenting my talk at Wagtail Space NL](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/wspace_2024.jpg)

However, I _did_ make it to Arnhem, the Netherlands 🇳🇱 to attend Wagtail Space
with my colleagues. It's a nice little city. [I presented my talk][wspace-talk]
in a cool old theatre. The talk was a bit too long, but it was worth spinning up
a bunch of Docker containers to show the different Wagtail versions.

Unsurprisingly, we had Indonesian food a few times. It was pretty good!

We also strolled around Amsterdam for a bit on the last day. Took the ferry to
cross over the [IJ][ij] and have lunch before we took the train.

## GSoC

Came back to Django for GSoC this year! Mentored Shafiya's project that builds
on top of my JSONField project. This time, we're adding a new feature that
allows [database-level updates to JSONField][gsoc-project].

It's so unreal to work on that bit of Django again – this time on the other end.
Even moreso to think about how it led to all the opportunities that got me here.
Speaking of which...

## DjangoCon US, road trip, GSoC Mentor Summit

Thibaud, Storm, and I flew to New York 🇺🇸 in September. We explored the city in
a day. Started off at Central Park, then the Statue of Liberty 🗽, a few iconic
buildings, and the Times Square.

We took the train to DC. Visited some landmarks for a few hours before
continuing the train journey to Durham, NC.

![Me presenting my talk at DjangoCon US](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/djcus_2024.avif)

At DjangoCon US, I got to talk about [how Django changed my life][djcus-talk].
It's about time to give the proper thanks and credits to the community.

![Me and a few people in the Wagtail room at the DjangoCon US sprints](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/djcus-sprints_2024.avif)

As always, it's nice to see familiar faces and meet new people. Someone got
their first PR to Wagtail during the sprints, which was cool 🐦

We narrowly avoided [Hurricane Helene][helene] as we headed to Memphis by car.

I was thinking of writing more details about the trip here but I think it'd be
better as a separate post.

![Thibaud, Storm, and me at the Times Square](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/timessquare_2024.avif)

![Thibaud, me, and Storm with our bikes by the Golden Gate bridge](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/goldengate_2024.avif)

In short, it was a trip from the east coast all the
way to the west coast. Read from right to left:

```
San Francisco 🚗 Los Angeles 🚗 Las Vegas 🚗 Hoover Dam 🚗 Grand Canyon 🚗 Albuquerque 🚗 Amarillo 🚗 Oklahoma City 🚌 Memphis 🚙 Nashville 🚙 Durham 🚃 Washington DC 🚃 New York City
```

![Me presenting my talk at the Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/mentorsummit_2024.avif)

At the GSoC Mentor Summit, I gave a lightning talk on Shafiya's project and how
it was a continuation of mine.

## Did somebody say Django?

[Went live for the first time ever on Twitch 🎥][first-twitch] as I worked on a
Django ticket. Did three more streams after to continue the work. Got some PRs
merged too! ✅

At the very last minute, I submitted my personal statement for the
[Django Steering Council elections][elections]. There were 11 other candidates,
all of them are prolific contributors.

I didn't get elected. It was close, though. Of the twelve candidates, only five
people were selected, and [I ended up at sixth][elections-results].

It's okay. Looking at the elected candidates, Django is surely in good hands.
I'm excited to see (and help) where Django is headed over the next two years.

## Streaming

![My freshly-built PC](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/rig_2024.avif)

I built a gaming PC this year. It's quite beefy. Can finally crank those
settings and still get the sweet sweet FPS.

My friend also urged me to rearrange my setup so the camera doesn't point to my
kitchen. It's probably one of the best things I did this year!

Now that the camera is rolling, why not do some gaming streams as well?

[Streamed myself playing Black Mesa][black-mesa]. Fun!

For a "first" playthrough – it's nice to capture your first-time moments. I do
streaming to have an archive of these. Not to be so serious and turn it into a
job or something. Though I certainly wouldn't mind if someone found it
interesting enough and paid for a sub.

## Music

Unfortunately, I didn't pick up my music instrument much this year. There's a
medical condition that affects my hands and makes it less enjoyable.

But, I did see some cool gigs this year!

<div class="bleed bleed-full">

- Jul 24: [The Jungle Giants][junglegiants] at Strange Brew, Bristol
- Oct 9: [Saint Motel][saintmotel] at Electric Brixton, London
- Nov 7: [Still Woozy][stillwoozy] at O2 Academy, Bristol
- Dec 13: [Kishi Bashi][kishibashi] at Thekla, Bristol

I should keep track of these in my [music palates pages][music-palates]. Will do
at some point...

## Play hard, work harder

Made quite a few accomplishments at work this year.

We started off with releasing Wagtail 6.0 in February. Rolled out the first
iteration of "universal listings", a revamp of the listing views. Also helped in
adding RTL language support, particularly in mirroring the SVG icons.

Iterated on the universal listings project over the subsequent releases – 6.1,
6.2, and 6.3.

<div class="bleed">

![The concurrent editing notification feature in action.](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/cen_2024.avif)

</div>

6.2 was quite something. We shipped ["concurrent editing notifications"][cen].
One, it's a presence list à la Google Docs. It lets you know if someone else is
editing the same content you're viewing. Two, it notifies you if that person
has saved a new version since you opened the page. It's a nice stop-gap as we
work our way towards autosave.

That feature was quite tricky to implement. There was a lot of nuances to ensure
the accessibility and user experience. So glad that I implemented a big chunk of
the work.

Then came 6.3. It's more modest than the previous ones, but it still packs a
punch. I refactored much of the legacy views to use the standard generic
class-based views we use throughout Wagtail.

[A work I started in 2023][preview-controller] was finally done: migrating the
preview panel code to Stimulus and adding the frontend unit tests. To top it
off, someone submitted a feature that allows you to customize the preview sizes.
It's a great release – an LTS, too.

Aside from the releases, we did two of the What's New in Wagtail webinars.
[One in March][wniw-march], and [one in October][wniw-october]. Each of them we
did twice, for the Europe and US audiences.

We also did a few sessions of the (paid)
[Django and Wagtail developer training programme][training-programme] that we
put out this year.

## What you're looking at

This site. It doesn't look all that different from last year. But it's actually
been [rebuilt with Astro][astro-rebuild]. Now it has [a search feature][search],
[an RSS feed][rss-feed], and [a sitemap][sitemap].

I'm very happy with the setup. Given how close it is to traditional vanilla
HTML and JS, I think I'm going to settle with this setup for quite a while.
<small>I said the same thing when I built this with Next.js, though...</small>

## Health

On the condition of my hands that I um, touched, earlier. I've seen the GP twice
now. They said it's not a cause for alarm. But still, it brings discomfort when
it gets in the way. It's been months and hasn't got much better 😔

Anyway!

I started running every week this summer. Got a bit better at it. It was pretty
consistent until I had to leave for the US trip. Did a few runs after, but the
weather's got cold so I haven't got back at it since.

Not sure if it's directly related, but this year I didn't touch much of the
medicine I brought from Indonesia. Maybe the running and the home exercises do
help after all!

## Friends and holidays

![Adam, me, Ester, and her partner](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/djangolondon_2024.avif)

Before I signed off from work, I attended the final Django London Meetup of the
year, where [we did the quiz][django-quiz]. I won this time! <small>And last
time, too.</small>

Didn't go anywhere for the end-of-year holidays, though.

![Me playing Basara 2 with my friend](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/couchgaming_2024.avif)

Thought about visiting my friend in Sweden, but the visa hassles didn't seem
worth it this time. We ended up playing PS2 games over the internet with the
help of [PCSX2][pcsx2] and [Parsec][parsec].

I also arranged a watch party with my friends. We saw [Heretic (2024)][heretic]
and [Sleep (2023)][sleep]. Both were very enjoyable. Even more so while chatting
with friends over Discord. Running [Syncplay][syncplay] on my small DigitalOcean
droplet was key.

## Personal stuff

Something quite significant happened this year.

For the past few years, I've been chipping away at my family's debts. It may
not be a significant amount depending on where you're coming from. But for us,
it was this big burden that we carried every day for many, many years.
Especially around ten, fifteen years ago.

My dad didn't earn much, especially since COVID struck, and he's now retired. Me
getting a job immediately after finishing uni made it a bit easier. A year
later, I got my current job and moved to the UK. Things have got more and more
manageable.

Near the end of this year, I finally paid off the last bit of those debts. It
felt great. We can finally breathe more freely.

## What's ahead

I'm writing this bit in 2025. Yeah, it's kinda cheating.

Well, it's time to have the so-called resolutions for the new year, isn't it?
Never really done it before, and I don't want to be too specific as I still want
to explore what's possible. ~~Also, because I don't want to be let down if
they're not accomplished.~~

So, here's what I'd like to achieve:

- **Read more books.** I barely read any books this year. Bought a kindle the year
  before, but I've only finished one book on it.
- **Write and publish more.** The new website code should be a good motivation
  to write more content here. In particular, I'd like to set up a TIL section so
  I can share some smaller pieces of things I learn.
- **Avoid instant gratification.** Pretty sure I spent an unhealthy amount of
  time reading and watching useless junk on the internet this year. It was
  probably enough to finish some books, games, and movies in my backlog that
  actually have value.
- **Learn another technology.** Maybe re-learn Godot or some other game engine.
  Or a programming language. More importantly, do something with it.
- **Be more physically active.** Running is quite enjoyable. Do more. Perhaps
  try something else too. Get a bike?

Of course, there are other things I'd like to do for the year. I haven't
mentioned anything Django or open source. No concrete plans yet. I didn't get to
be in the Django Steering Council, but I definitely want to do something in the
space. <small> (hint, hint) </small>

Also, [giscus][giscus] is almost at 9k stars and catching up with
[utterances][utterances]:

<div class="bleed">

[![Star History Chart of giscus and utterances](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=utterance/utterances,giscus/giscus&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#utterance/utterances&giscus/giscus&Date)

</div>

It's due for some rework. Hopefully I'll get to it in 2025.

Well, it's been a long post. If you made it this far – thank you. I hope 2024
has been kind to you. In any case, here's to a better year. Onwards and upwards!
