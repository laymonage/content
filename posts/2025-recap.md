Has it been another year already?

## The first three months

Not much to say here! Was a bit busy applying for an Ireland 🇮🇪 visa.

## Indonesia, pt. I

Went back to Jakarta in March for Ramadan and Eid. Just in time for my mother's
birthday, too.

We did a road trip all the way to [Bromo][bromo]. It's pretty much our first big trip
ever as a family and it was so much fun. I got all the way up <small>(to be fair, it
wasn't that high)</small> and saw the crater. I'm so glad to see more of my own country.

On an unrelated note, I had my first medical check-up after the trip. All good,
thankfully!

## DjangoCon Europe

Took the train from Bristol to Holyhead, and the Stena Line from Holyhead to
Dublin to attend [DjangoCon Europe][djceu25]. Never got on a big ferry like that
before, so that was a cool experience. More sustainable, too!

I didn't give a full talk this year, but I did a lightning talk on Wagtail.
Reviewed some PRs during the sprints and met a new contributor. The good stuff.

It's probably the most enjoyable DjangoCon Europe I've been. Maybe because
there's less pressure, but I also had a lot of fun with old friends and new.

## Bike

(Finally) bought a bike! Got a used one from the Bristol Bike Project. Have been
meaning to get one for a while, and it's probably my best purchase this year.

Took it to Bath via the railway path. First time seeing Bath and it was lovely.
Thinking of doing it every year now.

![Pulteney Weir, Bath, with three boats and the Pulteney Bridge visible in the background.](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/bath_2025.avif)

Also took it to Lamplighter's Marsh and picked some blackberries there. Quite
a nice little place out of town.

![Blackberries on the tree, some ripe and some not.](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/lamplighters_2025.avif)

## Indonesia, pt. II

Was asked to be one of the groomsmen for a friend's wedding, so I went back to
Jakarta around August. We've been friends for over 10 years now, and I'm so
happy to see him take the next step in life.

Our group of friends had a get-together a few nights before. A very casual stag
do, if you will. One friend had to join remotely from Japan, so we set up a call
on Discord as we played some games on the PS4.

Before I left, I went to the hospital to check on the medical condition I touched on last year. Again, the doctor said it's not a big deal. They gave me some steroid cream and it did help a bit. For a while, at least…

## PyCon UK

My first [PyCon UK][pyconuk], and my first PyCon ever!

Gave a talk about my journey from being a student to a maintainer. It's a rehash
of my DjangoCon US talk, but I thought it might appeal to a wider Python slash
open source audience.

![Me on stage giving my talk, with the title slide on the screen and a link to
sage.id/pyconuk25](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/pyconuk_2025.avif)

There were a few other Django people there, but I also met some cool new people.

It was my second time in Manchester. I quite like it when the weather was nice.
<small>(As with most places…)</small>

## On the trot

The autumn was just busy busy busy.

- PyCon UK (19–22 Sept.)
- Torchbox Tech Day (24 Sept.)
- Torchbox Company Day (25 Sept.)
- Wagtail Space (8–10 Oct.)
- Wagtail AI v3.0 release (9 Oct.)
- Wagtail 7.2 feature freeze (23 Oct.)
- Google Summer of Code Mentor Summit (23–25 Oct.)
- Django and Wagtail Developer Training (3–5, 10 Nov.)
- Wagtail 7.2 final release (5 Nov.)

Did a talk on Wagtail's UI components for the Torchbox Tech Day. Made the slide deck the day before. Then I had to present our in-progress Wagtail AI work at the company day. I kind of fumbled it, but oh well 🙈

Had to crunch a bit to get the Wagtail AI v3.0 release out in time _and_ present it at Wagtail Space. Only got time to prepare for the talk the day before.

Oh, and the day before Wagtail Space, Thibaud and I made the silly decision to try out the London branch of [Dave's Hot Chicken][daveshc]. We were defeated when we tried it in LA the previous year, so we thought we'd give it another try. We did manage to get through a Reaper burger this time around. But it was still a mistake. My body would agree.

## Germany 🇩🇪

GSoC Mentor Summit was in Munich this year, so I made a holiday out of it. Took a week and a few days off work after the 7.2 feature freeze. The event was good. I saw Paarth and Bhuvnesh, who did GSoC for Wagtail and Django, respectively.

![Mary, Stephanie, and Robert on the ballroom stage giving an orientation of the summit](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/mentorsummit_2025.avif)

I talked quite a bit with people from the Joomla community, comparing our different approaches to CMS and open source.

There were some interesting discussions around AI—a combination of scepticism and optimism—but mostly the latter. I was surprised that there wasn't much discussion around AI-generated contributions. Maybe it hasn't hit other organizations as hard?

It's my third time attending the summit. I probably won't go again next year.

Anyway, about Germany. I spent most of my time there doing long walks and grabbing coffee at different cafes each time. I spent a week in Munich, and another in Reutlingen/Tubingen area where my sister is studying.

## Other stuff

We started the work for 7.3 immediately after. Finally bringing an MVP of autosave to the table. It's quite the feature, to say the least.

Just like 2024, I attended the final Django London Meetup of the year, where
[we did another quiz][django-quiz]. I won this time! <small>Just like 2024, and 2023.</small>

Oh, and I did not attend any gigs this year. The only one I would've gone to might be Tycho in March, but I wasn't in the UK then.

## Indonesia, pt. III?!

Yes, I went back just before new year's eve. Another friend of mine was getting married
in January. Thought might as well go back over the holidays.

Caught up with friends from high school, and played some board games with friends from uni. Always happy to see them!

![Geo, Nat, Abe, and me with a board game on the cafe table](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/uni_2025ish.avif)

And yeah, yeah, this is technically 2026. But it's still over the holidays, so I was still in the 2025 frame of mind. The year 2026 officially starts once I publish this blog post 😜

Anyways, here's the wedding photo!

![May, Zuck, Sean, his wife, and me (I'm holding my phone with Sam's and Yoda's faces on a video call)](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/sean_wedding_2025ish.avif)

The wedding was only two days before I left for the UK again. So here I am.

## Global Talent visa 🇬🇧

My Skilled Worker visa (SWV) was expiring in September. So, for the first half of the year, I was busy preparing some documents to switch to the [UK Global Talent visa][uk-gtv] (GTV).

I didn't have to do this. Could've just extended my SWV. But by switching to GTV, I would be eligible for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) after living in the UK for three years.

Chuffed to say that I got it approved! Now I could apply for ILR, which I should do soon, since I only asked for 1 year of GTV.

## Personal stuff

This year has been quite a ride for me, in a few aspects. One in particular felt more like a series of rollercoaster rides.

For more than eight years, I had been holding on to a dream. I worked so hard to reach it, and there were times when it felt so close I could almost hold it. A few instances of self-sabotage and it all crumbled down. Been picking up the pieces over the past few years. Thought that was it.

A few months into the year, thought I saw signs of changes that would've opened up another chance. Leaned into it. Gave it the best shot I could.

And for a little while, there we were. Smiling at old times, thinking of new. Or so I thought.

But when each and every way either led to nowhere, a wall, or worse: a sign to turn around and not come back… Much as I hated to go back on my own words, perhaps it was time to let go.

To think that it was a dream of two. When it was a dream of one.

![A small pot of a succulent plant on a desk](https://cdn.laymonage.com/personal/img/succulent_2025.avif)

On a more trivial note, I didn't realise Twitter deletes accounts that have been deactivated for more than a month. So, there goes my main Twitter account. (It's a different one, where I mostly posted in Indonesian.) Not that I'd been using it much since it went downhill, nor did I happily keep using it. But I hadn't made an archive of my tweets. Losing a history of my thoughts in the past five years or so was a bit unfortunate.

## 2025 resolutions

Made some resolutions [last year][2024-recap] – how did I end up?

- **Read more books.** I only finished one book. Not better, not worse compared to 2024, but it does mean I did not accomplish this ❎
- **Write and publish more.** I did set up a [TIL section][til] as I had hoped. But it's still pretty barren, so maybe task failed successfully? ❎✅
- **Avoid instant gratification.** Pretty sure I reduced my doomscrolling, but I definitely could do better. Finished a bunch of games: Mafia III, Dead Space remake, Until Then, Signalis, Mafia DE, System Shock remake, Detention. Some of them on stream! Saw a bunch of films, too. ✅
- **Learn another technology.** Didn't quite do this as much as I hoped for, but I did learn a few things about reverse engineering, and streamed myself trying to pick up the [re4_tweaks mod][re4_tweaks]. Sooo, ✅?
- **Be more physically active.** Strava says I did 20 activities, 123.0 km, 15h25m in 2025. I did get a bike and did not record my weekly groceries rides. I also got my first sub-7:00/km pace on my regular harbourside run. So I think this is a ✅

Also, not resolutions, but I mentioned these:

- Became a navigator for Djangonaut Space ✅\
  Didn't go as well as I had hoped, but oh well.
- Did not do a rework of giscus ❎\
  But we did get it to 10k stars!

## What's ahead

Since last year's went pretty well, let's think about what I'd like to do in in 2026:

- **Read more books.** It's a leftover from last year's, but this time I think I'll have an easier time to get it done.
- **Write and publish more.** Still another item from last year's, but I'd like to make a bigger dent here. Maybe some personal thoughts as well. Though I'd like to see if I can keep it to a small audience. Or at least less likely to be consumed by AI. Or worse, gone to oblivion.
- **Learn something new.** Doesn't have to be tech. Doesn't have to be good at it by the end of the year. But maybe good enough to do or make something out of it.
- **Create and release one thing.** Not quite sure what it is, but it's not writing. Probably not code either. More on the artsy stuff, likely. A painting, a handicraft, a song cover, or some other thing.
- **Make a new friend.** In real life. Outside of a professional setting. I feel like my social skills have plummeted since I moved to the UK. Not sure if it's because of the language, culture, or just me. Difficult as it may be, I'd like to see it happen.

The feeling I'm getting for this year is to do things that have an impact to me personally.

Less so on the professional side. I've gone to more conferences than I ever thought I would've, and spoken at quite a few. Much as I love seeing friends at conferences, the energy (and money) it takes to attend one is not insignificant. I wouldn't mind missing a few this year. I also still have to sort out my ILR, so I have lots of reading to do.

Alright, this post has been long overdue, so I don't want to drag this out much longer. Thank you for reading this far. I hope your 2025 was delightful. Whether it was, or it wasn't, let's hope for a better year. Ta!
