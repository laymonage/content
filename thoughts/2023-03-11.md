  Saw Andrew Bird in London and BANNERS in Bristol, just two days apart.

This was last month, but I went to see Andrew Bird at the O2 Shepherd Bush,
London. I was there with a colleague who also loves his music.

He's one of my favourite musicians **ever**, so I'm so glad to finally have seen
his live performance!

That was on the 19th of February. Two days later, I went to another gig.

It was BANNERS at Thekla, Bristol!

His music showed up on my Spotify back in 2016. There were only one EP and a
few singles, but I loved them so much. With the type of music he makes, I knew
he was going to be big. However, he kind of fell off my radar after about a
year or two.

Turns out, his 2017 single "Someone to You" went massive in 2020 thanks to a
trend on TikTok. From there on, he seemed to have blown up. I'm glad more people
are discovering his music!

I bought a t-shirt to support him. Oh, and did I tell you I got the setlist?
