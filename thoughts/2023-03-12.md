  Went to Chamonix on a ski trip with my colleagues!
---

Last week, Torchbox went for a ski trip to Chamonix, France!

## Thursday

The Bristol crew took a coach to the London St. Pancras station early in the
morning. The timing was a bit tight, but we all made it before our train left,
thanks to some lobbying. It's the first time I took the Eurostar and I quite
enjoyed it!

By midday, we arrived at the Paris Gare du Nord station. Then we hopped to Paris
Gare de Lyon to take the train to Lyon Perrache.

From there, we took a coach and finally arrived in Chamonix for dinner.

## Friday

There was a beginner ski lesson in the morning. The lower slopes were a bit too
slippery so it wasn't very enjoyable. Or maybe I just suck at skiing.

Later that day, a few of us went to Nyon, Switzerland to visit the Outreachy
intern that we've been mentoring, Albina. After working together these past few
months, it was so cool to finally see her in person. The fact that it coincided
with the last day of her internship was so convenient.

We took the boat from Nyon to visit a small town of Yvoire, France. Yes, that
meant we crossed the border again üòÖ

Yvoire is a quiet little town that seemed so peaceful. I love it.

It was a fun little detour, but we had to go back to Chamonix for dinner that
night.

## Saturday

We took the cable car to go up to Aiguille du Midi.

The view up there was so breathtaking. It was quite literally, as I felt so
light headed every time I went up the stairs.

## Sunday

We had to return to the UK on Sunday. Before leaving, I went for a little hike
up a nearby trail.

Along the way home, we took a lovely group picture:

All in all, it was such an incredible trip.

I'm glad my Portugal visa won't expire until the 17th of March üòù
