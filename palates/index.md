Discovering new things is one of my favourite things to do. Some niche music
that takes you away, a film that makes you feel, or a book that leaves you
puzzled. It's a great feeling to find a piece of art that resonates with you in
some way.

Unfortunately, it's not always easy to find them. There's just so much out
there, and it's not unusual for something so good to be buried somewhere in the
noise, waiting to be found.

**Discoverability is a problem.**

One way to help is to share what you've found. Spread the word.

And that's what this section is about! I'll be sharing some of the things I've
found, and I hope you'll find something you like.

This is an ongoing effort, so I'll be adding more stuff here as I go.

## Music

From World War II pop music of the [Andrews Sisters][andrews-sisters] to
the latest album of [Summer Salt][summer-salt]. From the legendary
[Pink Floyd][pink-floyd] to the lesser-known
[Good Luck Finding Iris][good-luck-finding-iris]. Something's bound to catch
your ear!
