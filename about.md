Hi, I'm Sage. I build up and break down stuff in the open.

In early 2021, I got my bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Universitas
Indonesia. Shortly after, I worked as a Frontend Developer at a startup in
Indonesia for about a year. Then I joined [Torchbox][torchbox] to pursue my
passion in open source by developing [Wagtail CMS][wagtail] and its ecosystem.
Following one of my dreams, I moved to Bristol, UK in late 2022.

I enjoy using Django and I have made some contributions to it. During [Google
Summer of Code][gsoc] 2019, I implemented a [`JSONField`][jsonfield] feature
for all database systems supported by Django. The feature was merged and
included in the Django 3.1 release. I [documented my journey][documented] and
spoke about it at the [DjangoCon Europe 2020][djceu2020] virtual event and an
episode of the [DjangoChat][djangochat] podcast.

I love learning new things. Recently, I've been diving into front-end web
development and trying out React, Vue, and Svelte while studying the
differences between them. As an exercise, I made [giscus][giscus] and its
[component library][giscus-component].

I grew up in small districts of Jakarta. I spend my free time writing, reading,
playing music, and enjoying time alone or with my friends and family. I also
play [video games][steam] occasionally.
