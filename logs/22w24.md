## Birthday ðŸŽ‚

Turned 23 on Thursday.

Just stayed at home with my family and ordered some pizza. No relatives came
over, which was completely fine as I still had work to do and I could use less
distractions.

A <span class="cursor-help">friend</span> gave me a <span class="sr-only">bitter</span>sweet gift. It was nice, considering we opted to not buy a
cake.

## Fun trip

Sam and I went ice skating on Sunday!

That was my first time ice skating. As I imagined, it's not easy. I started
to get the hang of it after a while, but I mostly just walked and slid a little.
Couldn't glide yet.

And of course, I fell a few times. That was part of the fun, though!

We went to Taco Bell afterwards. It was also the first time I ate something from
Taco Bell. It was pretty good. Sam bought a takeaway for his girlfriend and I
got to meet her in person for the first time. I also bought some for my family.

I played Charlie Burg's three-part album and sang to it on the car ride. That
was [not][21w43] the first time I sang on a car ride ðŸ˜›

Needless to say, I had so much fun that day. It's amusing to think all these
activities were actually a Plan B. We initially planned to visit one of our
high-school teachers, but it turned out he couldn't meet us. Maybe we'll get to
visit him next week.

## Games

My friends and I finished the main story of
[a DLC for Borderlands 2][tiny-tina-dlc]. We also tried to play Borderlands 3,
but the game crashed a few times so we didn't continue.

I still played Fallout: New Vegas.

Only updated some dependencies.

## Work

Worked on some UI improvements and took a first stab at implementing the preview
panel in the new page editor. Had fun figuring out how to size the iframe and
all that.
