## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Updated the dependencies and the vendored math renderer element. I also released
new versions of the giscus-component library. Didn't have much energy for
anything else.

## Work

Added support for multiple preview modes in the preview panel.
[It's looking pretty good.][preview-pr]

## Other stuff

I met Geo on Thursday! He's my friend who also participated in GSoC 2019. He was
still in Jakarta until Saturday, so we decided to meet at a cafe in a nearby
bookstore.

On Friday, Sam and I went to our high school to meet our History and Indonesian
teachers. Our friend Zuck also joined. It's been years since we last saw our
teachers, so it's nice to finally catch up. We chatted for hours.

Here's a question for you: why are history and language teachers so chill?

My friends and I played Badminton on Sunday morning. We also played last week,
but I forgot to write it down.

I still played Fallout: New Vegas.
