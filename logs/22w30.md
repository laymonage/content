## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Made some significant updates this week!

- Added an option to use [strict title matching][strict-pr]. (Looking at it
  again, maybe I should've named it "exact title matching", but oh well...)
- [Fixed a race condition bug][fixed-race] that could cause discussions to be
  created more than once.
- [Prevent the input zoom-in][prevent-zoom] on iPhone Safari.
- Merged [Dutch][dutch] and [Arabic][arabic] localizations.
- Upgraded Tailwind to v3.1.6.
- [Improved][improve-rtl] RTL languages support.

Also released new versions of the giscus-component packages to add support for
strict title matching. Screwed up while releasing the Svelte package, so I had
to release another version, making the numbers out of sync.

## Work

[Extracted the queryset filtering code][extract-queryset] from Wagtail's base
`ReportView` to its generic `IndexView`. This means that the Snippets listing
view can have filters.

Opened [a PR][updated-status] to add Updated and Status columns to Snippets
listing. I initially also added support for ordering the Name column, but it
needs a way for developers to point out which database column it corresponds
to. Introducing a new API for this seems too early, so I decided to leave this
one out.

We've been working on a new UX for the scheduled publishing feature, but we
encountered some really tricky edge cases. We're trying to find a different
approach.

## Other stuff

Played badminton on Sunday. Not much else, really.

Haven't got back to Fallout: New Vegas yet as I spent a lot of time on giscus.
