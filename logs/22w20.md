## giscus ðŸ’Ž

[AWS Lambda added support for Node.js 16][aws-node16] this week, so we *finally*
could upgrade.

That means we could [drop the polyfill for `webcrypto`][drop-peculiar]. I made
[the issue][crypto-issue] for that just a little over a year ago.

Released new versions of the giscus-component library this week. Made it so that
the component is only rendered after it's mounted. The older (v1) release did
this, but I thought it would no longer be necessary with the move to web
components. It turns out that this causes [an issue][theme-issue] for sites that
are server-rendered (or statically generated) where the initial theme can't be
determined, so the component was always rendered with the `light` theme on
initial render.

Made a mistake when releasing the new versions: I forgot to update the web
component dependency on the React, Vue, and Svelte packages. No big deal,
though, as the change wasn't made in the web component. I'll update them next
week.

Anyhoo...

On Sunday, giscus turned one year old!

I wrote the [release announcement][release-announcement] last year. Time flies.

Within a year, we managed to get:

- a little over 2k stars (and users)
- sponsored
- translation contributions for 15+ languages

I'd say that's quite an accomplishment.

Thank you to all users and everyone who contributed!

## Work

Managed to get Revisions to work with Snippets. If your Django model extends
from `RevisionMixin` and is registered with Wagtail's `@register_snippet`
decorator, you'll automatically get revisions enabled on the model. This means
that you can revert to a previous revision and compare two revisions.

None of my PRs have been merged, so you can't test it from the `main` branch
yet. I'd expect this to take quite a while to review as the change from
`PageRevision` to `Revision` is quite significant. At least internally.

## Other stuff

Played some Borderlands 2 and Fallout: New Vegas, just like last week. I think
this will go on for quite some time, as both games are quite massive.

There was a family birthday on Saturday. Some relatives came over to celebrate.
Some of them were unexpected, but that's okay.

My friends and I played badminton on Sunday! It's the first time we played since
January, and the second time this year. Feels good to play again.
