## giscus üíé

Only updated some dependencies. Tried to merge [a PR][giscus-pr] to change the
status code from 404 to 204 when giscus can't find the discussion, but turns out
it still needs some adjustments.

## Work

Rebased my PRs and rearranged my commits. I also wrote
[a high-level overview][snippets-discussion] of the work I have been (and will
be) doing on Snippets. Presented that in the core team meeting. It went pretty
well.

This week's Thursday and Friday were bank holidays in the UK. My line manager is
on holiday this week and the next, so the PRs are gonna have to wait.

## Other stuff

I forgot to write it here, but I took a TB test on Saturday last week. Got the
results on Monday. All good, thankfully.

Finally got around to picking up my graduation certificate and transcript at
the university on Thursday. I had been holding off as I was too lazy to
complete the paperwork. Printing my bachelor thesis and internship (with
hardcover), burning the soft copy to a CD, getting my picture taken, yadda
yadda.

Met my friend who also went to pick up his graduation certificate. He just got
back from his hometown, so he brought some gifts. He's the [same friend][gsoc]
who also participated in GSoC back in 2019. I hadn't met him again since 2020.
Felt so good to see him again. Forgot to take photos, though üôÅ

Finished the main story of Borderlands 2 with my friends on Saturday. We
continued to play one of the DLCs, but we haven't got far.

Also played Fallout. Still fun. I'm so digging the 40s-50s music.
