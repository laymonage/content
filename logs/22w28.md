## giscus üíé

Updated Next.js to 12.2 and went back to use next-plugin-preact as I couldn't
get it to work without it for some reason...

Enabled SWC for the build process as they finally added support for
browserslist.

Also updated the math-renderer-element once again. It seems GitHub has added
some more security precautions and they now explicitly uses Lit to render the
HTML.

## Work

The preview panel is nearly there.

Added tests for the publishing action on Snippets.

Also created [a draft PR][snippet-preview] for adding preview support to Snippets.

## Eid al-Adha ‚ò™Ô∏è

It was Eid al-Adha on Sunday. Eid mubarak!

We just stayed at home and cooked Satay with the lamb meat that we got. Yum üòã

## Other stuff

Met up with someone special at the national library on Wednesday!

We were classmates back in ninth grade. It's been (more than five?) years since
we last saw each other, but we've been keeping touch.

It's the first time I'd been there. The place was quite cozy, but it's only open
until 4PM. I had to get in line to create a membership card, or otherwise I
wouldn't be able to get around. It took about an hour. Now that I've got my
card, it will be much easier if I want to visit again.

We couldn't chat much in the library, so we chat some more on the way home. She
studied Psychology, which is something I considered before settling with CS. We
talked about where each of us is going in the near future. It was a fun day!

On the weekend, I still played Fallout: New Vegas. Finally got to The Strip and
met Benny. This game has so many ways to go with the quests, it's awesome.
