## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Updated the dependencies and merged a PR for Portuguese localization.

I decided [not to merge the PR][decision] for changing the status code for
nonexisting discussions to 404.

## Work

We've started merging the PRs I've opened over the past few weeks. Technically,
you can already enable revisions in Snippets if you check out the `main` branch.

## DjangoCon Europe 2022

Looks like I'm going to be talking at DjangoCon Europe this year! I have other
news to share in the coming months, but some things are still uncertain. If all
goes as planned, I'll deliver the talk live in Porto.

## Other stuff

Watched [Days of Wine and Roses][dwr]. It's tragic. The soundtrack is great.

Chatted with Nat and he showed me his progress on a project he's been working
on. It's looking great! Can't wait to share it everywhere.

Played a **lot** of Fallout: New Vegas over the weekend. This game has so much
content. Loving the songs on the radio as well.

Badminton with my friends on Sunday. Enjoying this a lot while I can...
