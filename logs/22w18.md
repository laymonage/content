Updated some dependencies and that's it. Thought about rewriting the app using
[Remix][remix], but I'm still not fully convinced yet.

## Work

We're planning to add revisions to snippets. So, one of the things we need to do
was to [replace the `PageRevision` model with a generic `Revision` model][pr].

There were some difficulties getting `GenericForeignKey` to play nicely with how
Wagtail's `Page` model inheritance works. I spent a good chunk of time debugging
some of the tests as well. Even had to use the debugger instead of the good ol'
`print()`!

Had another pair programming session with my manager to figure things out. In
the end, we ended up ditching `GenericForeignKey` and we filter the ID and
content type manually instead. I'll see if I could rewire `GenericForeignKey`
into this somehow...

Ramadan ‚ò™Ô∏è ended on Sunday. Eid al-Fitr would be on Monday, so I would take the
day and the next off next week.

## Other stuff

Played some Borderlands 2 with the others on Tuesday. I finished Claire's
campaign in Resident Evil 2 Remake on Saturday. The true ending was interesting.

Since nobody else in my group of friends had the time to prepare some materials
for our "TEDx sessions" this year, I volunteered to have a live coding session
on Saturday. The idea was to write a Python task that can be run periodically
and send the result as a push notification using a Telegram bot. My friend
suggested the task to be "checking a subscribed [Webtoon][webtoon] comic every
day and see if there's a new episode that hasn't been read". I went ahead and
did it. I ended up explaining the basics of how web pages are loaded, how to
make use of the browser's DevTools, and making requests with httpx/requests.
That was really fun and we all learned a lot.

Watched the pilot episode of [Severance][severance] on Sunday. The concept is
really intriguing. Looking forward to watch more!

Extracted this site's content into a separate repository and added it as a
submodule to the website's repo. That means the content has its own commit
history regardless where it's going to be deployed. I think it's nice. I guess
you could say I _severed_ the repository...
