Only updated some dependencies. Don't have the energy to work on anything else
yet...

## Work

The preview panel has been merged. Yay! I've also been working on migrating the
modals in the Wagtail admin to use a new dialog component that has better
accessibility.

## Other stuff

Watched [Everything Everywhere All at Once][eeato] with Nat on Saturday! What an
emotional rollercoaster. <sup><sub>Tears were shed...</sub></sup>

We had Subway sandwiches for lunch. It's the first time I tried Subway. It was
pretty good. The vegetables were fresh ðŸ˜‹

I also hosted an online watch party with my high school friends on Saturday
night. We watched [Dabbe: Curse of the Jinn][dabbe]. It's an interesting horror
movie as it incorporates Islamic culture as part of the plot, so there were
things that we picked up on.

Forgot to wrote it here, but I hosted another party last week, and we watched
[Incantation][incantation].

We also played badminton on Sunday.

It's quite a social week this week!
