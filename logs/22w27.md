## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Wamted to update the dependencies but [an issue][next-issue] in Next.js 12.2
made me postpone it.

## Work

Been polishing the preview panel a lot. That, and rebasing the PRs as each one
is merged.

Went to VFS on Wednesday. Just gotta wait now...

## Other stuff

A <span class="cursor-help">friend</span> asked me to help reinstall Windows on
her old laptop and sell it. We reset the laptop at her house and went to a
nearby mall to sell it. The store didn't want to pay much for the laptop as its
condition was poor. In hindsight, it wasn't that bad of a deal.

I still played a lot of Fallout: New Vegas. More than 50 hours in and I haven't
even met Benny. Haven't played any of the DLCs either.

No badminton this week.
