  Wild week, both at work and in my personal life.

## giscus ðŸ’Ž

Google's [Closure Compiler Service][closure-compiler] API, which I had been
using to minify the client script, is down. Well, they did write that it's
been deprecated and will be removed, so it was just a matter of time.

As a result, I had to [do the minification locally][minify-locally].

I also made it so that giscus (and the homepage)
[defaults to the preferred color scheme theme][default-scheme].

And of course, I updated the dependencies as usual.

## Work

[Wagtail 4.0 RC1][wagtail-40rc1] is out!

We ended up not merging the new scheduled publishing UX as we feel that it's
still "too hot". I managed to get all the other things in, though.

What a wild week.

## Other stuff

As [I wrote before][22w26], I'm going to be speaking at DjangoCon Europe 2022 in
Portugal. That means I have to obtain a Schengen visa.

When I contacted them last month, the Portugal embassy in Jakarta were in the
middle of a transition to use VFS instead of handling visa applications
themselves. They didn't accept new applications and suggested to apply via VFS
starting on August 1st.

Last Monday, I went to the VFS to apply for the visa (but I forgot to write
it here). After I handed in my application, it turns out that they had some
connection problems while sending my biometrics data to the Portugal embassy.
So, they asked me to re-record my biometrics the next day.

I did go there the next day and had my biometrics recorded again. All was good.

Or so I thought.

This Tuesday, they just called me back, saying that they failed to send my
biometrics data _again_. God knows why they didn't call earlier.

They didn't store the data (for privacy reasons), so they needed to get my
biometrics yet another time. So that I don't have to go there for the third
time, they offered to visit my house and get my biometrics recorded at home.

They did, on Wednesday morning. With how small my house is, it was such a hassle
setting their devices and props up so they can take my photo.

After all was done, I asked them whether they had managed to send the data this
time. They said yes, but honestly? I won't be surprised if they still managed to
screw it up again.

Let's hope third time's the charm.

Anyways, this gets more complicated than I thought. I have a deadline for
another big thing, but with the current circumstances I might have to push it
back.

I also haven't prepared the slides for my talk. Don't have the energy yet,
unfortunately.

I've got so many things on my plate and I could use some peace of mind...
