## giscus ðŸ’Ž

[GitHub added support for mathematical expressions in Markdown.][gh-math] I
thought their [Markdown Renderer API][gh-md] wouldn't be updated any time soon
to include rendered math expressions in the result.

I was half-wrong. They did update the API, but it returns a custom element with
the math expressions inside it. So, the following input:

```latex
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
```

yields the following output:

```html
<p dir="auto">
  <math-renderer
    class="js-display-math"
    style="display: block"
    data-static-url="https://github.githubassets.com/static"
    >$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$</math-renderer
  >
</p>
```

This means it's up to us to define the `<math-renderer>` custom element and how
it renders the math expression.

I didn't intend to hack a solution immediately, but one discovery urged me to
try something out:

It turns out GitHub provides sourcemaps for its client code. I _think_ I
remember reading about this a while ago, but I can't remember where. Anyway, it
turns out we can see the source code for their `<math-renderer>` element.

I shamelessly ["adapted"][math-pr] it to be used in giscus. Thus, we now support
rendering mathematical expressions!

I've also updated the theme colors and [added][themes-pr] the light and dark
Tritanopia themes.

## Work

We had another edition of What's New in Wagtail on Wednesday and Thursday! I
presented the work I've been (and will be) doing on Snippets. The recording
should be up soon!

## Other stuff

My friends and I played badminton on Sunday afternoon. It's the first time we
played in the afternoon. That was a nice change of vibe.

I also played some video games, Borderlands 2 and Fallout: New Vegas, like last
week.
