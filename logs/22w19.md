## giscus 💎

Updated some dependencies and that's it. Didn't really have the energy to do
anything else.

On the bright side, we have reached 2k stars on GitHub! This is a major
milestone for me. Not to mention the project is only a little less than a year
old. It's nice to see other people are using it ☺️

## Work

Got the generic `Revision` model ([#8441][pr-8441]) to work. Managed to extract
some of the methods from Wagtail's `Page` model into a `RevisionMixin`
([#8482][pr-8482]). Now, the mixin can be applied to any model. I also made it
so that if a Snippet extends from `RevisionMixin`, revisions will automatically
be created every time an instance is created/edited ([#8495][pr-8495]).

## Eid al-Fitr ☪️

We had Eid al-Fitr on Monday. Eid Mubarak! 🙏

My family and I visited some relatives in the area. We also visited my
grandmother who lives in another city. This is the first time we went there
since COVID.

Food was delicious, as always. My mother made [opor ayam][opor-ayam] and chayote
soup. We ate them with some [Ketupat][ketupat] my aunt made 😋

## Other stuff

I finally gave the present to my friend on Thursday, which includes the
drawing I made last month. I had been holding off on putting it here. Now that
the person has received it, here it is!

Guess who it is 😛

On the weekend, I played some Borderlands 2 with the others. I also started
playing Fallout: New Vegas. Fun.

Binged the first season of Severance on Monday. It's soooo awesome. I also can't
get enough of the intro.

Watched a bunch of movies this week for some reason. [Memories of Murder][mom],
[Mother][mother], and [Insomnia][insomnia]. All great movies.

## RIP Bagol 🥀

Our (street) cat, Bagol, died on Sunday morning. He had been sick and unable to
walk for the past month. We tried our best to save him, but it was time for him
to go.

You will be missed.
